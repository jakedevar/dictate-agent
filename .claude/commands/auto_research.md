# Auto Research (Autonomous Mode)

You are tasked with conducting fully autonomous research across the codebase. Unlike the interactive `/research_codebase` command, you will make all decisions independently and produce a complete research document without pausing for human input.

## CRITICAL: AUTONOMOUS OPERATION PRINCIPLES

1. **NO QUESTIONS TO USER** - Make best-guess decisions and document them
2. **NO PAUSES** - Continue through the entire workflow
3. **DOCUMENT ALL DECISIONS** - Create an audit trail of choices made
4. **ONLY STOP ON BLOCKING ERRORS** - Technical failures that prevent progress
5. **COMPREHENSIVE OUTPUT** - The final document should be self-contained

## YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO DOCUMENT THE CODEBASE AS IT EXISTS

- DO NOT suggest improvements or changes
- DO NOT perform root cause analysis
- DO NOT propose future enhancements
- DO NOT critique the implementation
- ONLY describe what exists, where it exists, how it works

## Input Handling

When this command is invoked:

1. **If a research topic/question is provided**: Begin research immediately
2. **If no topic provided**: Research the overall codebase architecture and structure

## Autonomous Research Process

### Step 1: Parse and Expand Research Scope

1. **Read any directly mentioned files FULLY** (no limit/offset)
2. **Analyze the research question** and decompose into sub-questions
3. **Identify scope boundaries** - what's in scope vs out of scope
4. **Document initial understanding**:
   ```
   AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LOG
   =======================
   Topic: [Research question/area]
   Scope: [What we're investigating]
   Out of Scope: [What we're explicitly NOT investigating]
   Initial Assumptions: [Any assumptions made about intent]
   ```

### Step 2: Spawn Parallel Research Sub-Agents

Create a comprehensive research plan and spawn ALL of these agents in parallel:

**Codebase Research Agents:**
```
Use Task tool with subagent_type="codebase-locator":
- Prompt: "Find all files and directories related to [topic]. Return structured list with full paths, organized by purpose (core logic, tests, configs, types, utilities). Do NOT evaluate or critique - only locate and categorize."

Use Task tool with subagent_type="codebase-analyzer":
- Prompt: "Analyze how [specific component] works. Trace data flow, identify key functions, document interfaces. Include file:line references. Do NOT suggest improvements - only document current behavior."

Use Task tool with subagent_type="codebase-pattern-finder":
- Prompt: "Find examples of [pattern/feature] in the codebase. Show concrete code examples with file:line references. Document variations found. Do NOT recommend one pattern over another."
```

**Context Research Agents (if thoughts/ directory exists):**
```
Use Task tool with subagent_type="thoughts-locator":
- Prompt: "Find all documents in thoughts/ related to [topic]. Categorize by type (research, plans, tickets, notes). Return paths only."

Use Task tool with subagent_type="thoughts-analyzer":
- Prompt: "Extract key insights from [specific documents]. Focus on decisions made, rationale, and historical context. Note any information that may be outdated."
```

**CRITICAL: Spawn ALL relevant agents in a SINGLE message to maximize parallelism**

### Step 3: Synthesize Findings (No Human Review)

After ALL sub-agents complete:

1. **Compile findings** from all agents
2. **Resolve conflicts** - when agents report different information:
   - Prefer live codebase over documentation
   - Prefer recent files over old files
   - Document the conflict in the research document
3. **Identify gaps** - areas that couldn't be researched
4. **Cross-reference** findings to build complete picture

### Step 4: Generate Metadata

Run: `hack/spec_metadata.sh` (if available) or gather:
- Current date/time with timezone
- Git commit hash: `git rev-parse HEAD`
- Branch name: `git branch --show-current`
- Repository name

### Step 5: Write Research Document

**Filename**: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic-kebab-case].md`

```markdown
---
date: [ISO timestamp]
researcher: autonomous-agent
git_commit: [commit hash]
branch: [branch name]
repository: [repo name]
topic: "[Research Topic]"
tags: [research, autonomous, relevant-tags]
status: complete
autonomous: true
decisions_made: [count of autonomous decisions]
---

# Research: [Topic]

**Date**: [timestamp]
**Mode**: Autonomous (no human review during research)
**Git Commit**: [hash]
**Branch**: [branch]

## Research Question

[Original query or auto-generated scope]

## Autonomous Decisions Made

> These decisions were made automatically without human input:

| Decision Point | Choice Made | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| [What needed deciding] | [What was chosen] | [Why] |

## Summary

[High-level findings answering the research question]

## Detailed Findings

### [Component/Area 1]
- What it does: [description]
- Location: [file:line references]
- How it connects: [relationships to other components]
- Key interfaces: [APIs, functions, types]

### [Component/Area 2]
[Same structure...]

## Code References

| File | Lines | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `path/to/file.ext` | 123-145 | [What this code does] |

## Architecture Documentation

[Current patterns, data flow, design decisions found]

## Historical Context (from thoughts/)

[If thoughts/ directory was searched]
- `thoughts/path/to/doc.md` - [Key insight]

## Research Gaps

> Areas that could not be fully researched:

- [Gap 1] - [Why it couldn't be researched]
- [Gap 2] - [Suggested follow-up]

## Confidence Assessment

| Finding | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| [Key finding] | High/Medium/Low | [Why this confidence level] |

## Open Questions for Human Review

> These questions arose during research but were not blocking:

1. [Question that a human might want to clarify]
2. [Another question for optional follow-up]
```

### Step 6: Add GitHub Permalinks (If Applicable)

1. Check if on main branch or commit is pushed
2. Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`
3. Generate permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`
4. Replace local references with permalinks

### Step 7: Sync and Report

1. Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` (if available)
2. Output completion summary:

```
AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH COMPLETE
============================
Document: thoughts/shared/research/[filename].md
Duration: [time taken]
Sub-agents spawned: [count]
Decisions made autonomously: [count]
Confidence: [overall assessment]
Gaps identified: [count]

The research document is ready for review.
```

## Decision Heuristics

When you encounter ambiguity, use these heuristics:

| Situation | Decision Rule |
|-----------|--------------|
| Unclear scope boundary | Include more rather than less - can be trimmed later |
| Multiple interpretations of question | Research all interpretations, document each |
| Conflicting information | Document both, prefer code over docs |
| Missing files/directories | Note as gap, continue with available info |
| Agent returns no results | Try broader search, then document as gap |
| Uncertain relevance | Include with low confidence flag |

## Error Handling

**Recoverable Errors** (continue after logging):
- Sub-agent returns empty results → Document gap, continue
- File not found → Note in gaps, continue
- Git commands fail → Use placeholder, continue

**Blocking Errors** (stop and report):
- Cannot write to output directory
- All sub-agents fail
- Critical tool unavailable

## Important Notes

- **Parallel execution**: Always spawn multiple agents in single message
- **No partial reads**: Always read files FULLY (no limit/offset)
- **Path handling**: Remove "searchable/" from thoughts paths
- **Audit trail**: Document every autonomous decision
- **Self-contained**: Final document should need no external context
